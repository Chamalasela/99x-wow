### When?
Based on our experience, a DD can come in handly in a few situations, namely : 
-  Beginning a new Software Development partnership
   - Expansion of an existing system
   - Modernization of a legacy system
-   Stakeholder mandated due to system failing to meet targets
-   Due Diligence as a service


### Outcome

The output will be presented to the relevant stakeholders in the form of a concise report
