# Introduction to privacy regulations in USA

## The Privacy Act of 1974

The Privacy Act of 1974 is a federal law that protects the privacy of
individuals' personal information collected by the federal government.
The law applies to all federal agencies, including the Department of
Justice.

The Privacy Act gives individuals the following rights:

  - To be informed of what information the government has about
    them: Individuals have the right to request from a federal agency a
    copy of any record that the agency maintains about them.
  - To request access to their personal information: Individuals have
    the right to inspect and copy their records, with some exceptions.
  - To correct any inaccurate or incomplete information: Individuals
    have the right to request that a federal agency correct any
    inaccurate or incomplete information in their records.
  - To have their information destroyed: Individuals have the right to
    request that a federal agency destroy their records, with some
    exceptions.
  - To file a complaint with the government if they believe their
    privacy rights have been violated: Individuals have the right to
    file a complaint with the U.S. Office of Management and Budget if
    they believe their privacy rights have been violated.

The Privacy Act also requires federal agencies to:

  - Collect personal information only for specific, legitimate
    purposes: Federal agencies may only collect personal information
    that is relevant and necessary for a specific purpose.
  - Use personal information only for those purposes: Federal agencies
    may only use personal information for the purpose for which it was
    collected.
  - Protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, or
    disclosure: Federal agencies must take reasonable steps to protect
    personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
  - Retain personal information only as long as necessary: Federal
    agencies must retain personal information only as long as it is
    necessary for the purpose for which it was collected.

The Privacy Act is an important law that helps to protect the privacy of
individuals' personal information. It does this by giving individuals
certain rights and by requiring federal agencies to follow certain
procedures when collecting and using personal information.

The Privacy Act applies to all types of personal information that is
collected by the government, including names, addresses, Social Security
numbers, and medical records. However, there are some exceptions to the
law, such as information that is collected for national security
purposes.

### Comparison with GDPR

- Scope
    - The PA applies to federal government agencies and contractors that
      handle personal information about US citizens or lawful permanent
      residents. The GDPR applies to any organization that processes the
      personal data of EU residents, regardless of the organization's
      location.
- Individual rights
    - Under the PA, individuals have the right to access their personal
      information held by federal agencies, to request corrections to
      inaccurate information, and to object to certain uses of their
      information. Under the GDPR, individuals have a broader range of rights,
      including the right to be forgotten, the right to data portability, and
      the right to object to automated decision-making.
- Consent
    - The PA does not explicitly require consent for the collection and
      processing of personal information. However, the GDPR requires
      organizations to obtain explicit consent from individuals before
      collecting or processing their personal data.
- Enforcement
    - The PA is enforced by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the
      Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties (OPCL) within the Department of
      Justice. The GDPR is enforced by data protection authorities (DPAs) in
      each EU member state.
- Penalties
    - The PA provides for civil penalties of up to $5,000 for violations. The
      GDPR provides for significantly higher penalties of up to 4% of annual
      global turnover or €20 million, whichever is greater.
- Overall
    - The GDPR is a more comprehensive and stringent data privacy law than the
      PA. It provides individuals with a broader range of rights and imposes
      stricter requirements on organizations that process personal data.

## The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)

  - FERPA is a federal law that protects the privacy of student records
    held by educational institutions that receive federal funding.

  - Parents of students under 18 have the right to:
    
      - Inspect and review their child's education records.
      - Request that the school correct any inaccurate or misleading
        information in their child's records.
      - Restrict the disclosure of information from their child's
        records.

  - Students who are 18 years old or older have the same rights as
    parents.

  - Schools can disclose information from student records without
    parental consent or student authorization in certain limited
    circumstances, such as:
    
      - To school officials who have a legitimate educational interest
        in the information.
      - To other schools that the student is transferring to.
      - To the government, if required by law.
      - To organizations providing services to the school, such as the
        school nurse or the school psychologist.

  - Students have the right to file a complaint with the Department of
    Education if they believe their FERPA rights have been violated.

FERPA is an important law that helps to protect the privacy of student
records. It gives parents and students the right to access and control
their educational records, and it limits the circumstances in which
schools can disclose information from those records.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about FERPA:

  - FERPA applies to all schools that receive federal funding, including
    public schools, private schools, and colleges and universities.
  - FERPA does not apply to records that are kept by law enforcement
    agencies or by the courts.
  - FERPA does not apply to records that are kept by parents or
    guardians.

### Comparison with GDPR

- Scope
    - FERPA applies to educational institutions that receive funding from the
      US Department of Education. This includes public elementary schools,
      secondary schools, and postsecondary institutions. The GDPR applies to
      any organization that processes the personal data of EU residents,
      regardless of the organization's location.
- Individual rights
    - Under FERPA, students have the right to inspect and review their
      education records, to request corrections to inaccurate information, and
      to consent to the disclosure of their education records to third
      parties. Under the GDPR, individuals have a broader range of rights,
      including the right to be forgotten, the right to data portability, and
      the right to object to automated decision-making.
- Consent
    - FERPA does not require consent for the collection and processing of
      student education records. However, the GDPR requires organizations to
      obtain explicit consent from individuals before collecting or processing
      their personal data.
- Enforcement
    - FERPA is enforced by the US Department of Education. The GDPR is
      enforced by data protection authorities (DPAs) in each EU member state.
- Penalties
    - FERPA provides for civil penalties of up to $5,000 and suspension or
      termination of federal funding for violations. The GDPR provides for
      significantly higher penalties of up to 4% of annual global turnover or
      €20 million, whichever is greater.
- Overall
    - The GDPR is a more comprehensive and stringent data privacy law than
      FERPA. It provides individuals with a broader range of rights and
      imposes stricter requirements on organizations that process personal
      data.

| Enforcement       | US Department of Education                                    | DPAs in EU member states                                                           |
| Penalties         | Up to $5,000 and suspension or termination of federal funding | Up to 4% of annual global turnover or €20 million, whichever is greater            |

## The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

  - HIPAA is a federal law that protects the privacy and security of
    health information.

  - It applies to health care providers, health plans, and health care
    clearinghouses.

  - HIPAA gives individuals the right to:
    
      - Inspect and copy their health information.
      - Request that their health information be corrected.
      - Restrict the disclosure of their health information.

  - HIPAA also requires health care providers to:
    
      - Protect health information from unauthorized access, use, or
        disclosure.
      - Implement security measures to protect health information.

Here are some of the key provisions of HIPAA:

  - Privacy Rule: This rule sets national standards for the protection
    of individuals' health information. It requires health care
    providers to obtain patient consent before disclosing their health
    information, except in certain limited circumstances.

  - Security Rule: This rule sets national standards for the security of
    electronic health information. It requires health care providers to
    implement appropriate security measures to protect health
    information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

  - Transactions and Code Sets Rule: This rule standardizes the
    electronic exchange of health information. It requires health care
    providers to use standard codes and formats when transmitting health
    information electronically.

  - Unique Identifiers Rule: This rule establishes national standards
    for unique identifiers for health care providers, health plans, and
    individuals. These identifiers are used to track health information
    and to prevent fraud and abuse.

  - Enforcement Rule: This rule establishes the procedures for enforcing
    HIPAA. It allows the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
    to impose civil and criminal penalties on organizations that violate
    HIPAA.

HIPAA is an important law that helps to protect the privacy and security
of health information. It gives individuals control over their health
information and it helps to ensure that health information is used only
for its intended purposes.

If you have any questions about HIPAA, you can contact the HHS Office
for Civil Rights. You can also find more information about HIPAA on the
HHS website.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about HIPAA:

  - HIPAA applies to all health care providers, including doctors,
    hospitals, and insurance companies.
  - HIPAA does not apply to information that is not considered health
    information, such as your name, address, or date of birth.
  - HIPAA does not apply to information that is de-identified, meaning
    that it does not contain any information that could be used to
    identify you.

### Comparison With GDPR

- Scope
    - HIPAA applies to healthcare providers, health insurers, and other
      healthcare-related entities in the United States. The GDPR applies to
      any organization that processes the personal data of EU residents,
      regardless of the organization's location.
- Individual rights
    - Under HIPAA, individuals have the right to access their PHI, to request
      corrections to inaccurate information, and to restrict the disclosure of
      their PHI to certain third parties. Under the GDPR, individuals have a
      broader range of rights, including the right to be forgotten, the right
      to data portability, and the right to object to automated
      decision-making.
- Consent
    - HIPAA does not require explicit consent for the collection and
      processing of PHI for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations.
      However, the GDPR requires organizations to obtain explicit consent from
      individuals before collecting or processing their personal data.
- Enforcement
    - HIPAA is enforced by the US Department of Health and Human Services
      (HHS). The GDPR is enforced by data protection authorities (DPAs) in
      each EU member state.
- Penalties
    - HIPAA provides for civil penalties of up to $50,000 per violation and
      criminal penalties of up to 10 years in prison for certain violations.
      The GDPR provides for significantly higher penalties of up to 4% of
      annual global turnover or €20 million, whichever is greater.

## The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)

  - The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) is a federal law that was enacted
    in 1999.
  - The GLBA was passed to reform the financial services industry and to
    create a more competitive environment.
  - The GLBA also includes provisions that protect the privacy of
    consumers' financial information.

The GLBA consists of three main parts:

  - The Financial Privacy Rule: This rule requires financial
    institutions to provide consumers with a privacy notice that
    explains how the institution collects, uses, and shares their
    personal financial information.
  - The Safeguards Rule: This rule requires financial institutions to
    implement security measures to protect consumers' personal financial
    information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
  - The Pretexting Provisions: These provisions prohibit the practice of
    pretexting, which is obtaining someone's personal financial
    information by false pretenses.

The GLBA applies to all financial institutions that offer financial
products or services to consumers, such as banks, credit unions,
securities firms, insurance companies, and mortgage lenders.

The GLBA gives consumers the following rights:

  - The right to receive a privacy notice from their financial
    institution.
  - The right to opt out of certain disclosures of their personal
    financial information.
  - The right to access and correct their personal financial
    information.
  - The right to file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission
    (FTC) if they believe their privacy rights have been violated.

The GLBA is an important law that helps to protect the privacy of
consumers' financial information. It gives consumers control over their
personal financial information and it helps to ensure that financial
institutions are responsible with how they collect, use, and share that
information.

If you have any questions about the GLBA, you can contact the FTC. You
can also find more information about the GLBA on the FTC's website.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about the GLBA:

  - The GLBA does not apply to all businesses that collect personal
    financial information.
  - The GLBA does not apply to information that is not considered
    personal financial information, such as your name, address, or date
    of birth.
  - The GLBA does not apply to information that is de-identified,
    meaning that it does not contain any information that could be used
    to identify you.

### Comparison with GDPR

- Scope
    - The GLBA applies to financial institutions in the United States, such as
      banks, credit unions, and investment firms. The GDPR applies to any
      organization that processes the personal data of EU residents,
      regardless of the organization's location.
- Individual rights
    - Under the GLBA, consumers have the right to access their financial
      information, to request corrections to inaccurate information, and to
      opt out of the sharing of their information with third parties. Under
      the GDPR, individuals have a broader range of rights, including the
      right to be forgotten, the right to data portability, and the right to
      object to automated decision-making.
- Consent
    - The GLBA does not require explicit consent for the collection and
      sharing of financial information. However, the GDPR requires
      organizations to obtain explicit consent from individuals before
      collecting or processing their personal data.
- Enforcement
    - The GLBA is enforced by a variety of federal and state agencies,
      including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Consumer Financial
      Protection Bureau (CFPB), and bank regulators. The GDPR is enforced by
      data protection authorities (DPAs) in each EU member state.
- Penalties
    - The GLBA provides for civil penalties of up to $100,000 per violation.
      The GDPR provides for significantly higher penalties of up to 4% of
      annual global turnover or €20 million, whichever is greater.
- Overall
    - The GDPR is a more comprehensive and stringent data privacy law than the
      GLBA. It provides individuals with a broader range of rights and imposes
      stricter requirements on organizations that process personal data.

| **Feature**       | **GLBA**                                    | **GDPR**                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)

  - COPPA is a federal law that protects the privacy of children under
    the age of 13.
  - It was passed in 1998 and went into effect in 2000.
  - COPPA applies to websites and online services that collect personal
    information from children under 13.
  - Personal information is information that can be used to identify a
    child, such as their name, address, phone number, or email address.

COPPA requires websites and online services that collect personal
information from children under 13 to:

  - Get parental consent before collecting or using the child's personal
    information.
  - Provide parents with notice of their privacy practices.
  - Allow parents to review their child's personal information and to
    delete it.
  - Not collect personal information from children under 13 without
    parental consent for certain activities, such as targeted
    advertising.

COPPA is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC can
impose civil penalties on websites and online services that violate
COPPA.

COPPA is an important law that helps to protect the privacy of children
online. It gives parents control over their children's personal
information and it helps to ensure that websites and online services are
responsible with how they collect and use that information.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about COPPA:

  - COPPA does not apply to websites and online services that are
    directed to adults only.
  - COPPA does not apply to websites and online services that do not
    collect personal information from children under 13.
  - COPPA does not apply to websites and online services that collect
    personal information from children under 13 but do not use it for
    commercial purposes.

### Comparison with GDPR

- Scope
    - COPPA applies to operators of websites and online services that are
      directed to children under the age of 13, or who have actual knowledge
      that they are collecting personal information from children under the
      age of 13. The GDPR applies to any organization that processes the
      personal data of EU residents, regardless of the organization's
      location.
- Age of consent
    - COPPA sets the age of consent for the collection and processing of
      children's personal information at 13 years old. The GDPR sets the age
      of consent at 16 years old, but allows individual member states to lower
      the age of consent to a minimum of 13 years old.
- Parental consent
    - COPPA requires operators of websites and online services to obtain
      parental consent before collecting, using, or disclosing personal
      information from children under the age of 13. The GDPR also requires
      organizations to obtain consent from parents or guardians before
      processing the personal data of children under the age of 16. However,
      the GDPR allows member states to provide for exceptions to this
      requirement, such as when the processing is necessary for the protection
      of the vital interests of the child.
- Individual rights
    - Under COPPA, parents have the right to access their children's personal
      information, to request corrections to inaccurate information, and to
      have their children's personal information deleted. Under the GDPR,
      children have the same rights as adults, including the right to access
      their personal data, to request corrections to inaccurate information,
      and to have their personal data deleted.
- Enforcement
    - COPPA is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The GDPR is
      enforced by data protection authorities (DPAs) in each EU member state.
- Penalties
    - COPPA provides for civil penalties of up to $46,517 per violation. The
      GDPR provides for significantly higher penalties of up to 4% of annual
      global turnover or €20 million, whichever is greater.
- Overall
    - The GDPR is a more comprehensive and stringent data privacy law than
      COPPA. It provides children with the same rights as adults and imposes
      stricter requirements on organizations that process the personal data of
