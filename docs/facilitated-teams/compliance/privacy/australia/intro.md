## Background

  - The Australian Privacy Act 1988 (APA) is a federal law that
    regulates the collection, use, and disclosure of personal
    information by Australian organizations. It applies to all
    organizations that carry on business in Australia, regardless of
    their size or location.
  - The APA was enacted in response to concerns about the increasing
    collection and use of personal information by organizations in
    Australia. It is designed to protect individuals' privacy by setting
    standards for the handling of personal information and giving
    individuals control over their own information.
  - The APA has 13 principles, and they govern standards, rights and
    obligations around:
      - the collection, use and disclosure of personal information.
      - an organization or agency’s governance and accountability.
      - integrity and correction of personal information.
      - the rights of individuals to access their personal information.
  - The APA also gives individuals the right to access their personal
    information held by organizations, to request that their information
    be corrected or deleted, and to complain about breaches of the APA.
  - The APA is enforced by the Australian Information Commissioner
    (AIC). The AIC has the power to investigate complaints about
    breaches of the APA and to act against organizations that breach the
    law.
  - The APA introduced a number of new requirements for organizations,
    including a requirement to obtain consent before collecting
    sensitive personal information and a requirement to notify
    individuals of data breaches.

## Principles

The 13 privacy principles can be found[here](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles/australian-privacy-principles-quick-reference) with links for detailed forms.

1.  Open and transparent management of personal information
      - Ensures that APP entities manage personal information in an open
        and transparent way. This includes having a clearly expressed
        and up to date APP privacy policy.

2.  Anonymity and pseudonymity
      - Requires APP entities to give individuals the option of not
        identifying themselves, or of using a pseudonym. Limited
        exceptions apply.

3.  Collection of solicited personal information
      - Outlines when an APP entity can collect personal information
        that is solicited. It applies higher standards to the collection
        of sensitive information.

4.  Dealing with unsolicited personal information
      - Procedures to follow when the data received is unsolicited.

5.  Notification of the collection of personal information
      - Outlines when and in what circumstances an APP entity that
        collects personal information must tell an individual about
        certain matters.

6.  Use or disclosure of personal information
      - Outlines the circumstances in which an APP entity may use or
        disclose personal information that it holds.

7.  Direct marketing
      - An organization may only use or disclose personal information
        for direct marketing purposes if certain conditions are met.

8.  Cross-border disclosure of personal information
      - Outlines the steps an APP entity must take to protect personal
        information before it is disclosed overseas.

9.  Adoption, use or disclosure of government related identifiers
      - Outlines the limited circumstances when an organization may
        adopt a government related identifier of an individual as its
        own identifier, or use or disclose a government related
        identifier of an individual.

10. Quality of personal information
      - An APP entity must take reasonable steps to ensure the personal
        information it collects is accurate, up to date and complete. An
        entity must also take reasonable steps to ensure the personal
        information it uses or discloses is accurate, up to date,
        complete and relevant, having regard to the purpose of the use
        or disclosure.

11. Security of personal information
      - An APP entity must take reasonable steps to protect personal
        information it holds from misuse, interference and loss, and
        from unauthorized access, modification or disclosure. An entity
        has obligations to destroy or de-identify personal information
        in certain circumstances.

12. Access to personal information
      - Outlines an APP entity’s obligations when an individual request
        to be given access to personal information held about them by
        the entity. This includes a requirement to provide access unless
        a specific exception applies.

13. Correction of personal information
      - Outlines an APP entity’s obligations in relation to correcting
        the personal information it holds about individuals

## Exceptions to the Australian Privacy Principles

  - The information handling requirements imposed by some APPs do not
    apply if a ‘permitted general situation’ or ‘permitted health
    situation’ exists. It is nevertheless open to an APP entity to
    comply with the APP requirements even though an exception applies

  - Permitted general situation ([Chapter C: Permitted general situations |OAIC](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles/australian-privacy-principles-guidelines/chapter-c-permitted-general-situations))
      - Lessening or preventing a serious threat to life, health or
        safety
      - Unreasonable or impracticable to obtain consent
      - Reasonably believes collection, use or disclosure is necessary
      - Lessen or prevent a serious threat
      - Taking appropriate action in relation to suspected unlawful
        activity or serious misconduct
      - Locating a person reported as missing
      - Reasonably necessary for establishing, exercising or defending a
        legal or equitable claim
      - Reasonably necessary for a confidential alternative dispute
        resolution process
      - Necessary for a diplomatic or consular function or activity
      - Necessary for certain Defense Force activities outside Australia

  - permitted health situations ([Chapter D: Permitted health situations|OAIC](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles/australian-privacy-principles-guidelines/chapter-d-permitted-health-situations#what-are-permitted-health-situations))
      - Collection — providing a health service
      - Collection — conducting research; compiling or analyzing
        statistics; management, funding or monitoring of a health
        service
      - Use or disclosure — conducting research; compiling or analyzing
        statistics
      - Use or disclosure — necessary to prevent a serious threat to the
        life, health or safety of a genetic relative
      - Disclosure — responsible person for an individual

## Comparison to the GDPR

  - The GDPR has a number of stricter requirements than the Australian
    Privacy Act, such as the requirement for explicit consent and the
    right to data portability.
  - The GDPR applies to organizations that process the personal data of
    EU residents, regardless of where the organization is located. This
    means that Australian businesses that target or serve EU residents
    must comply with the GDPR.
  - The GDPR has higher penalties for non-compliance than the Australian
    Privacy Act.
  - Australian businesses that operate both in Australia and in the EU
    should comply with both the GDPR and the Australian Privacy Act.
