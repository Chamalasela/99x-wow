# Introduction to privacy regulations in UK

The UK privacy model is a robust framework that governs the protection
of personal data within the United Kingdom. This document provides a
detailed overview of the key components, laws, and principles that form
the foundation of the UK privacy model.

The UK privacy model is primarily governed by the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is applicable throughout the
European Union (EU), including the UK.

In April 2016, the European Union (EU) introduced the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) to regulate the handling of personal data
of EU citizens. It took effect in 2018, aiming to enhance data
protection.

Soon after, in June 2016, the UK held a Brexit referendum, leading to
its eventual exit from the EU. To prepare for this, the UK incorporated
EU regulations into its domestic law through the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018. The GDPR was part of UK law until December 2020
when it was replaced by the UK GDPR.

## Keyword explanation  
  
- Data Protection Act 2018: The Data Protection Act 2018 is the UK's data
protection legislation that replaced the Data Protection Act 1998. It
incorporates the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) into UK law. It governs the processing of personal data and
outlines the rights and responsibilities of data controllers and data
processors.

- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation): GDPR is a comprehensive
European Union regulation that, even after Brexit, continues to apply in
the UK. It is designed to protect the privacy and personal data of
individuals. It sets rules for data processing, data subject rights, and
imposes significant fines for non-compliance.

- ICO (Information Commissioner's Office): The ICO is the UK's independent
regulator for data protection and privacy. It enforces data protection
laws, provides guidance to organizations, and handles complaints related
to data protection and privacy issues.

- Personal Data: Personal data refers to any information that can be used
to identify an individual, either directly or indirectly. This includes
names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and even digital
identifiers like IP addresses.

- Consent: Consent is one of the lawful bases for processing personal data
under GDPR. It requires individuals to give clear, informed, and
unambiguous permission for their data to be processed for a specific
purpose. Consent can be withdrawn at any time.

- Right to be Forgotten (Right to Erasure): This right allows individuals
to request the deletion of their personal data under certain conditions.
Organizations must comply with such requests, unless there are legal
grounds for retaining the data.

- Data Breach: A data breach is a security incident where personal data is
accidentally or unlawfully accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.
Organizations are required to report data breaches to the ICO and
affected individuals under certain circumstances.

- Data Controller: The data controller is an entity (usually an
organization) that determines the purposes and means of processing
personal data. They are responsible for ensuring that data processing
complies with data protection laws.

- Data Processor: A data processor is an entity that processes personal
data on behalf of the data controller. Processors are also subject to
data protection laws and must follow the instructions of the controller.

- Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA): A PIA is a systematic assessment of how
a particular data processing activity may impact the privacy of
individuals. It helps organizations identify and mitigate potential
privacy risks.

- Subject Access Request (SAR): An SAR is a request made by an individual
to obtain access to their own personal data held by an organization. The
organization must respond to the request and provide the requested
information.

- Privacy by Design: This is a concept that advocates for the integration
of data protection measures into the design and development of products,
services, and systems from the beginning, rather than as an
afterthought.

- Privacy Policy: A privacy policy is a document that outlines an
organization's practices and policies regarding the collection, use, and
protection of personal data. It informs individuals about how their data
is handled and their privacy rights.

### Data Protection Act 2018

The Data Protection Act 2018 serves as the primary legislation governing
data protection in the UK.
It implements provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) into UK law, ensuring consistency and alignment with European
data protection standards.

### Data Protection Principles

The UK privacy model is based on a set of data protection principles
that organizations must adhere to when processing personal data.
These principles include fairness, lawfulness, transparency, purpose
limitation, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity,
and confidentiality.
Each principle serves to ensure that personal data is processed in a
lawful, secure, and responsible manner, protecting the rights and
privacy of individuals.

### Individual Rights

The UK privacy model recognizes and safeguards the rights of individuals
in relation to their personal data.

- Key individual rights include:
- Right to be informed: Individuals have the right to be informed about
  how their personal data is being processed.
- Right of access: Individuals can request access to the personal data
  that organizations hold about them.
- Right to rectification: Individuals can request the correction of
  inaccurate or incomplete personal data.
- Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten"): Individuals can request the
  deletion of their personal data under certain circumstances.
- Right to restrict processing: Individuals can request a limitation on
  the processing of their personal data.
- Right to data portability: Individuals can request the transfer of their
  personal data to another organization.
- Right to object: Individuals can object to the processing of their
  personal data in certain situations.

### Consent

Consent is a fundamental aspect of the UK privacy model.
Organizations must obtain valid and explicit consent from individuals
before processing their personal data.
Consent should be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous,
allowing individuals to have control over their data.

### Data Security

The UK privacy model emphasizes the importance of robust data security
measures.
Organizations are required to implement appropriate technical and
organizational measures to protect personal data from unauthorized
access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
Data security measures include encryption, access controls, regular
audits, and employee training.

### Data Breach Notification

In the event of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a
risk to individuals' rights and freedoms, organizations must notify the
Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) without undue delay.
Additionally, affected individuals should be informed about the breach
and the potential impact on their personal data.

### Accountability

The UK privacy model emphasizes accountability for organizations.
This includes maintaining records of data processing activities,
conducting Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) for high-risk
processing activities, and appointing a Data Protection Officer (DPO) in
certain cases.
Organizations are responsible for demonstrating compliance with data
protection laws and regulations.

### International Data Transfers

The UK privacy model addresses the transfer of personal data outside the
UK.
It provides mechanisms, such as standard contractual clauses and
adequacy decisions, to ensure that international data transfers comply
with data protection requirements.

### Regulatory Oversight

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is the independent
regulatory authority responsible for enforcing data protection laws in
the UK.
The ICO has the power to investigate organizations, issue fines, and
take enforcement actions against those that violate data protection
regulations.

## Scope of Application

### Personal Scope

The UK GDPR and the Act pertain to the processing of personal data by
controllers or processors. Personal data is defined in accordance with
Article 4(1) of the UK GDPR and Section 3 of the Act as information that
relates to an identified or identifiable living individual. It is
important to note that these regulations do not apply to information
related to deceased individuals, nor do they cover the processing of
data concerning legal entities, such as companies. Such matters are
beyond the scope of the UK GDPR and the Act.

### Territorial Scope

The UK GDPR and the Act have a territorial scope that encompasses the
processing of personal data within the territory of the UK and, under
certain circumstances, extends to extraterritorial processing occurring
outside of the UK. The provisions governing territorial scope can be
found in Article 3 of the UK GDPR and Section 207 of the Act.

The data protection legislation is applicable to the processing of
personal data in the following contexts:

Within the activities of an 'establishment' in the UK, regardless of
whether the actual processing occurs in the UK. Determining whether a
controller or processor has an 'establishment' can be complex and may
include criteria such as the presence of an office, branch, or
subsidiary in the UK.

When processing the personal data of individuals physically present in
the UK by a controller or processor not established in the UK. This
applies to processing activities related to either:

Offering goods and services to individuals in the UK, regardless of
whether a fee is charged for these services. This could involve
targeting a retail or social media website to individuals in the UK
using local currency or language.

Monitoring the behavior of individuals, as long as the behavior occurs
within the UK. This may include building profiles of individuals through
the use of cookies to improve targeted advertising.

In situations where personal data is processed by a controller not
established in the UK, and domestic law applies due to public
international law.

### Material Scope

The UK GDPR and the Act encompass the automated or structured processing
of personal data, including 'special category data' and 'criminal
convictions and offenses data,' as further detailed in Articles 9 and 10
of the UK GDPR, respectively. This includes:

The processing of personal data, either wholly or partially, by
automated means. While not explicitly defined, this is likely to
encompass processing by computers or other technologies.

The processing of personal data through non-automated means, provided it
forms part of a filing system or is intended to form part of such a
system. This is likely to include organized paper files, contact lists,
and address books.

For public authorities subject to the Freedom of Information Act 2000,
this also includes manual unstructured processing of personal data.

## Data Protection Authority \| Regulatory Authority

### Main regulator for data protection

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) serves as the primary data
protection regulator in the UK. It carries out its responsibilities and
functions in accordance with Article 51 of the UK GDPR and Section 115
of the Data Protection Act (the Act). The ICO is also responsible for
more detailed functions and duties, as described below.

Main powers, duties, and responsibilities

The ICO's tasks and powers are outlined in Articles 57 and 58 of the UK
GDPR, respectively. Its primary duties include monitoring and enforcing
the UK GDPR, which involves handling complaints from data subjects and
conducting investigations. Additionally, the ICO provides advice to
controllers and processors when required, such as in cases where a Data
Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) under Article 36 necessitates
consultation with the ICO. The ICO is also responsible for issuing
guidance and documents, including codes of conduct and Standard
Contractual Clauses (SCCs).

The ICO wields extensive investigative powers, including the authority
to conduct audits on controllers or processors, search premises, issue
warnings, reprimands, and fines, impose limitations and bans on data
processing, suspend international data flows, and mandate specific
communications to be made to data subjects. The ICO also possesses
advisory and authorization powers and can approve safeguards for
international data transfers, such as Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs).

The Act complements the functions and powers set out in the UK GDPR in
the following ways:

Part 5 of the Act includes specific provisions that supplement the ICO's
duties and powers, including safeguards imposed on the exercise of the
ICO's powers.

Part 6 of the Act elaborates on the enforcement powers of the ICO,
including the authority to impose information notices, assessment
notices, enforcement and penalty notices, powers of entry and
inspection, and the specific criminal offenses that the ICO can
prosecute in the UK.

The ICO is mandated to carry out its tasks and exercise its powers with
complete independence, as outlined in Article 52 of the UK GDPR.

### Key Definitions

- Personal Data: Personal data refers to information related to an
  identified or identifiable living natural person, as defined in Article
  4(1) of the UK GDPR and Sections 3(2) and 3(3) of the Act. An
  identifiable natural person is someone who can be identified, directly
  or indirectly, through factors such as a name, identification number,
  location data, online identifier, or specific physical, physiological,
  genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social characteristics.

- Sensitive Data: The UK GDPR and the Act recognize two categories of
  sensitive data subject to additional safeguards. The first category is
  'special category data,' which includes data revealing racial or ethnic
  origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade
  union membership, genetic data, biometric data for unique
  identification, health data, or data concerning an individual's sex life
  or sexual orientation. The second category is 'criminal convictions and
  offenses data,' encompassing data related to alleged offenses by the
  individual and legal proceedings or sentencing.

- Data Controller: A data controller is a natural or legal person, public
  authority, agency, or other entity that, either alone or jointly with
  others, determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.

- Data Processor: A data processor is a natural or legal person, public
  authority, agency, or other entity that processes personal data on
  behalf of the data controller, following the controller's instructions
  and typically under a written contract.

- Data Subject: A data subject is an identified or identifiable natural
  person whose personal data is being processed and to whom the personal
  data pertains.

- Biometric Data: Biometric data comprises personal data derived from
  specific technical processing related to the physical, physiological, or
  behavioral characteristics of a natural person, allowing for unique
  identification, such as facial images or dactyloscopic data.

- Health Data: Health data, or 'data concerning health' as termed in the
  UK GDPR, encompasses personal data related to the physical or mental
  health of a natural person, including the provision of healthcare
  services, revealing information about their health status.

- Pseudonymization: Pseudonymization refers to the processing of personal
  data in a manner that detaches it from a specific data subject, provided
  that additional information is maintained separately and is subject to
  technical and organizational measures ensuring the data is not
  attributable to an identified or identifiable natural person.

## Legal Bases

In the context of data processing under the UK General Data Protection
Regulation (UK GDPR), various legal bases can be relied upon for
handling personal data. These legal bases determine when and how data
can be processed and are outlined in the following paragraphs.

- Consent (Article 6(1)(a) of UK GDPR): Consent is a valid legal basis
when the data subject has provided explicit and informed permission for
their data to be processed for specific purposes. The data subject can
withdraw their consent at any time. This basis applies to both regular
personal data and "special category data," with the latter requiring a
higher standard of explicit consent.

- Contract with the Data Subject (Article 6(1)(b) of UK GDPR): This legal
basis applies when processing data is necessary for fulfilling a
contract to which the data subject is a party or for taking
pre-contractual steps at the request of the data subject. When dealing
with "special category data" or "criminal convictions and offences
data," an additional legal basis may be required.

- Legal Obligations (Article 6(1)(c) of UK GDPR): Data processing is
permissible when it's required to comply with a legal obligation imposed
on the data controller. For "special category data" and "criminal
convictions and offences data," additional legal bases may be necessary.

- Interests of the Data Subject (Article 6(1)(d) of UK GDPR): Data
processing can be justified to protect the vital interests of the data
subject or another person, especially in emergency situations. A similar
basis exists for "special category data" and "criminal convictions and
offences data" when the data subject cannot provide consent.

- Public Interest (Article 6(1)(e) of UK GDPR): Data processing is allowed
when it's necessary for a task performed in the public interest or the
exercise of official authority by the data controller. The Act specifies
various functions that qualify as "public interest." Additional legal
bases may be needed for "special category data" and "criminal
convictions and offences data."

- Legitimate Interests of the Data Controller (Article 6(1)(f) of UK
GDPR): Data processing for the legitimate interests of the data
controller or a third party is acceptable unless it conflicts with the
data subject's fundamental rights and freedoms, particularly for child
data subjects. Public authorities should use Article 6(1)(e) instead of
this basis. Additional legal bases may be required for "special category
data" and "criminal convictions and offences data."

- These legal bases serve as the primary mechanisms for processing
personal data. However, for more sensitive data types such as "special
category data" and "criminal convictions and offences data," the Act
contains additional legal bases detailed in Schedule 1. Some legal bases
may necessitate the use of an appropriate policy document as defined in
Schedule 1, Part 4. The Act also includes exemptions, such as those for
the "special purposes," like journalism, where the requirement for a
legal basis may be waived. Additionally, when engaged in direct
marketing, controllers must ensure they comply with the requirements
specified by PECR for sending electronic communications to individuals,
including obtaining prior consent where applicable.

### Principles

There are seven data protection principles that govern all data
processing, and which are set out in Article 5 of the UK GDPR. Personal
data must be:

- Lawfulness, fairness and transparency principle: Processed lawfully,
  fairly, and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject
  (Article 5(1)(a));

- Purpose limitation principle: Collected for specified, explicit, and
  legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is
  incompatible with those purposes (save for certain archiving purposes,
  as defined) (Article 5(1)(b));

- Data minimization principle: adequate, relevant, and limited to what is
  necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed)
  (Article 5(1)(c));

- Accuracy principle: Accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date,
  whereby every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data
  that is inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which it is
  processed, is erased, or rectified without delay (Article 5(1)(d));

- Storage limitation principle: Kept in a form which permits
  identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the
  purposes for which the personal data is processed (save for archiving
  purposes, as defined) (Article 5(1)(e)); and

- Integrity and confidentiality: Processed in a manner that ensures
  appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against
  unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss,
  destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational
  measures (Article 5(1)(f)).

- Finally, the controller is responsible for, and must be able to
  demonstrate compliance with these principles (e.g. by way of policies
  and records). This final principle is called the 'accountability'
  principle (Article 5(2) of the UK GDPR).

## Controller and Processor Obligations

Controller and Processor Obligations under UK GDPR involve various
aspects, including Data Processing Notification and Data Transfers.

### Data Processing Notification

The Data Protection (Charges and Information) Regulations 2018 govern
data processing notification requirements in the UK GDPR. Data
controllers must pay a data protection charge to the ICO within the
first 21 days of each charge period, unless they qualify for an
exemption. The information that must be provided to the ICO within this
timeframe includes the data controller's name, address, the number of
staff, annual turnover, and whether the controller is a public
authority. The charge varies based on the organization's size and type.
Failure to pay the correct fee can result in fines of up to £4,350.
Exemptions exist for specific types of data processing, such as
personal, family, or household affairs, public registers, and legal
proceedings.

### Data Transfers

Data transfers in the context of international data transfer of personal
data are subject to specific conditions and safeguards outlined in the
UK GDPR. Adequate data transfers can occur based on adequacy regulations
established by the UK Secretary of State, such as the European Economic
Area (EEA) countries, Gibraltar, and countries with adequacy decisions.
In the absence of adequacy regulations, appropriate safeguards are
required, which can include legally binding agreements, standard data
protection clauses, codes of conduct, or certification mechanisms.
Derogations, or exceptions, for data transfers may apply in limited
circumstances, such as consent, contractual necessity, public interest,
legal claims, vital interests, or when transfers concern public
registers. In certain cases, if none of these conditions apply, a
transfer may still proceed if it's not repetitive, involves a limited
number of data subjects, serves compelling legitimate interests, and
provides suitable safeguards.

These obligations ensure compliance with data protection regulations in
the UK, covering both notification requirements and the transfer of
personal data, including international transfers.

Data processing records, as mandated by Article 30 of the UK GDPR,
require specific details for both controllers and processors:

### Controllers

- Mandatory information to be included consists of the controller's
  name, contact details, joint controller information (if applicable),
  the controller's representative, and the Data Protection Officer (DPO)
  details.

- A description of the processing purposes.

- Information about the categories of data subjects and the categories
  of personal data.

- Disclosure recipients, including those in third countries or
  international organizations.

- Details on transfers of personal data to third countries or
  international organizations, along with documentation of suitable
  safeguards where applicable.

- Optional information, if possible, includes the anticipated data
  erasure timeframes and a general description of technical and
  organizational security measures (Article 32(1)).

### Processors

- Mandatory information includes the processor's name, contact details,
  the relevant controller's details, the controller's representative (if
  applicable), and the DPO.

- Information about the categories of processing conducted on behalf of
  each controller.

- Details on personal data transfers to third countries or international
  organizations, along with documentation of suitable safeguards where
  applicable.

- Optional information, if possible, should include a general
  description of technical and organizational security measures (Article
  32(1)).

- Small organizations with fewer than 250 employees are exempt from
  maintaining mandatory data processing records, unless their processing
  poses a risk to data subjects, is not occasional, or involves 'special
  category data' or 'criminal convictions and offenses data.'

### Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

- DPIAs are required in specific circumstances, such as when processing
  is likely to pose a high risk to individuals' rights and freedoms.

- DPIAs are also mandated for systematic and extensive automated
  profiling, large-scale processing of 'special category data' or
  'criminal convictions and offenses data,' and systematic monitoring of
  publicly accessible areas.

- Additional criteria for DPIAs include innovative technologies, denial
  of service, large-scale profiling, biometric data, genetic data, data
  matching, invisible processing, tracking, targeting vulnerable
  individuals, and a risk of physical harm.

- Exceptions to the DPIA requirement exist, including when there is no
  likely high risk, when the processing is similar to a previously
  assessed operation, or when supervisory authorities have previously
  reviewed the processing.

- The ICO may publish a whitelist of exempted processing operations.

- Controllers should seek advice from a DPO and consult with the ICO if
  the residual risk of processing remains high after mitigation
  measures.

- The DPIA Guidance provides checklists and a template for conducting
  DPIAs.

Conducting a DPIA may require consultation with the supervisory
authority, and the ICO will notify the controller of the acceptance of
the DPIA for consultation within ten days.

The DPIA Guidance provides additional information, and the ICO's
template for DPIAs offers practical guidance on compliance with DPIA
requirements.

### Data Protection Officer Appointment

- Data controllers are generally required to designate a Data Protection
  Officer (DPO) unless they are a court or judicial authority acting in
  a judicial capacity.

- Mandatory DPO appointments are required under certain circumstances,
  such as when processing is conducted by a public authority, involves
  large-scale systematic monitoring of data subjects, or includes
  large-scale processing of 'special category data' or 'criminal
  convictions and offenses data.'

- The government has proposed replacing the DPO requirement with the
  designation of suitable individuals responsible for privacy management
  and data protection compliance.

### Role of the DPO

- The DPO is responsible for monitoring compliance with the UK GDPR,
  providing advice to the controller or processor, and serving as a
  liaison with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).

- The DPO should have advanced knowledge and abilities, especially when
  dealing with complex or high-risk data processing.

- Contact details of the DPO must be published and communicated to the
  ICO.

### Data Breach Notifications

- Controllers must notify the ICO without undue delay, and ideally
  within 72 hours, when they become aware of a data breach unless it
  poses no risk to individuals' rights and freedoms.

- Processors must notify their controller of a breach without undue
  delay.

- Individuals must be notified if a breach is likely to result in a high
  risk to their rights and freedoms, with some exceptions.

### Data Retention

- Data should not be kept longer than necessary for its processing
  purposes, except for specific archiving purposes.

- Retention periods are often linked to legal requirements or the nature
  of the data.

### Children's Data

- Special protections exist for children under the UK GDPR.

- Children must be at least 13 years old to provide valid consent for
  data processing.

- Data processing involving children often requires a Data Protection
  Impact Assessment (DPIA).

### Special Categories of Personal Data

- The UK GDPR generally prohibits the processing of 'special category
  data' unless specific lawful grounds, supplemented by the Act, are
  met.

- The processing of 'criminal convictions and offenses data' is also
  subject to strict conditions and safeguards.

### Controller and Processor Contracts

- A contract or legal agreement must be in place between the controller
  and processor, including mandatory clauses.

- The contract should address various elements, including instructions
  for processing, confidentiality, security measures, subprocessors,
  assisting the controller with data subject rights, compliance
  obligations, data deletion or return, and audit and inspection
  provisions.

Exceptions to the data protection and privacy framework in the United
Kingdom

While the data protection and privacy framework in the United Kingdom is
comprehensive, there are certain exceptions and scenarios where data
protection laws may not apply in the same way. It's important to be
aware of these exceptions and limitations:

- National Security: National security concerns can sometimes override
  data protection rules. Intelligence agencies and law enforcement may
  have exemptions or special provisions for processing personal data for
  national security purposes.

- Law Enforcement: Law enforcement agencies may have certain exemptions
  for processing personal data when it is necessary for the prevention,
  investigation, detection, or prosecution of criminal offenses. This
  includes considerations like the "crime and taxation" exemption under
  the Data Protection Act 2018.

- Journalism, Literature, and Art: Data protection laws allow for
  exemptions related to freedom of expression, which includes journalism,
  literature, and art. Journalists, authors, and artists have some leeway
  in processing personal data in the pursuit of these creative and
  informative activities.

- Research and Statistics: Data used for research and statistical purposes
  may be subject to different rules. Researchers can be exempt from some
  data protection requirements if they are working in the public interest,
  as long as they follow ethical guidelines.

- Legal Proceedings: Data protection rights may be limited when they
  conflict with legal proceedings. Lawyers and courts may have a
  legitimate need to process personal data as part of legal actions.

- Health and Social Care: In some cases, health and social care providers
  may process personal data without explicit consent if it is in the vital
  interests of the data subject, or for public health purposes, such as
  responding to epidemics.

- Employee Data: Employee data is often subject to data protection
  regulations, but there are certain exemptions for HR purposes.
  Organizations can process employee data for employment-related purposes,
  but they must still comply with specific rules.

- De-identified Data: Data protection laws apply to personal data, so data
  that has been properly anonymized or de-identified may not fall under
  the same regulations, as it no longer relates to identifiable
  individuals.

- Household Exemption: Data used for purely personal, or household
  activities is generally exempt from data protection regulations. This
  applies to data kept within the context of a personal home and not for
  professional or commercial purposes.

- Legal Basis: Organizations may process personal data without explicit
  consent if they have a lawful basis for doing so, such as the necessity
  of processing for the performance of a contract, compliance with a legal
  obligation, protection of vital interests, or the legitimate interests
  of the data controller or a third party.

- It's important to note that even in cases where exceptions apply, data
  controllers and processors must still adhere to the core principles of
  data protection, including ensuring data security and protecting
  individuals' rights as much as possible within the bounds of the
  exceptions. Data protection authorities like the Information
  Commissioner's Office (ICO) in the UK provide guidance on how to
  navigate these exceptions while respecting data subjects' rights and
  privacy.
