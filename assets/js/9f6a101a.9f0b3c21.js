The house's foundation should deliver expected qualities based on soil in the land, the size of the building, and not forget the requirements of the residents. The needs of the residents are prone to change over time; however, fundamentals such as the house's layout, the strength of the base, and electrical and plumbing lines are difficult to change after initial laying out. In this essence, the digital product architecture is not much different from the architecture of a building. That's why the architecture decisions need to be carefully analyzed and provisioned as they are costly to change later."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.h3,{id:"the-challenge-for-architects",children:"The Challenge for Architects"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The architects have to take these decisions one way or the other with the limited information available at the early stages of the development. There is no right or wrong decision at this level, and one must balance the different tactics to gain the most optimal solution to achieve the business outcomes.

Imagine you are a startup with a short time window and limited financing to enter the market. What's most important here is to keep the Architecture simple enough for faster software delivery to the market.

Therefore, though speed is needed, the product must comply with the required level of Secops, such as secure coding, vulnerability assessment, and active monitoring."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And one of the main challenges with software products is that things change over time due to market dynamics.
